 *                         I2C State Monitoring Functions
 *
 ****************************************************************************************
 * This I2C driver provides three different ways for I2C state monitoring
 *  depending on the application requirements and constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1) Basic state monitoring:
 *    Using I2C_CheckEvent() function:
 *    It compares the status registers (SR1, SR2 and SR3) content to a given event
 *    (can be the combination of one or more flags).
 *    It returns SUCCESS if the current status includes the given flags
 *    and returns ERROR if one or more flags are missing in the current status.
 *    - When to use:
 *      - This function is suitable for most applications as well as for startup
 *      activity since the events are fully described in the product reference manual
 *      (RM0016).
 *      - It is also suitable for users who need to define their own events.
 *    - Limitations:
 *      - If an error occurs (ie. error flags are set besides to the monitored flags),
 *        the I2C_CheckEvent() function may return SUCCESS despite the communication
 *        hold or corrupted real state.
 *        In this case, it is advised to use error interrupts to monitor the error
 *        events and handle them in the interrupt IRQ handler.
 *
 *        @note
 *        For error management, it is advised to use the following functions:
 *          - I2C_ITConfig() to configure and enable the error interrupts (I2C_IT_ERR).
 *          - I2C_IRQHandler() which is called when the I2C interrupts occur.
 *          - I2C_GetFlagStatus() or I2C_GetITStatus() to be called into the
 *           I2C_IRQHandler() function in order to determine which error occurred.
 *          - I2C_ClearFlag() or I2C_ClearITPendingBit() and/or I2C_SoftwareResetCmd()
 *            and/or I2C_GenerateStop() in order to clear the error flag and
 *            source and return to correct communication status.
 *
 *
 *  2) Advanced state monitoring:
 *     Using the function I2C_GetLastEvent() which returns the image of both SR1
 *     & SR3 status registers in a single word (uint16_t) (Status Register 3 value
 *     is shifted left by 8 bits and concatenated to Status Register 1).
 *     - When to use:
 *       - This function is suitable for the same applications above but it allows to
 *         overcome the limitations of I2C_GetFlagStatus() function (see below).
 *         The returned value could be compared to events already defined in the
 *         library (stm8s_i2c.h) or to custom values defined by user.
 *       - This function is suitable when multiple flags are monitored at the same time.
 *       - At the opposite of I2C_CheckEvent() function, this function allows user to
 *         choose when an event is accepted (when all events flags are set and no
 *         other flags are set or just when the needed flags are set like
 *         I2C_CheckEvent() function).
 *     - Limitations:
 *       - User may need to define his own events.
 *       - Same remark concerning the error management is applicable for this
 *         function if user decides to check only regular communication flags (and
 *         ignores error flags).
 *
 *
 *  3) Flag-based state monitoring:
 *     Using the function I2C_GetFlagStatus() which simply returns the status of
 *     one single flag (ie. I2C_FLAG_RXNE ...).
 *     - When to use:
 *        - This function could be used for specific applications or in debug phase.
 *        - It is suitable when only one flag checking is needed (most I2C events
 *          are monitored through multiple flags).
 *     - Limitations:
 *        - When calling this function, the Status register is accessed. Some flags are
 *          cleared when the status register is accessed. So checking the status
 *          of one Flag, may clear other ones.
 *        - Function may need to be called twice or more in order to monitor one
 *          single event.
 *
 *  For detailed description of Events, please refer to section I2C_Events in
 *  stm8s_i2c.h file.
